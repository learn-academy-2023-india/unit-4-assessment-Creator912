# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1. Both have a similar data type in having boolean expressions that can return true or false values.

2. Both are cross platform programs that can be seen and/used in our computers terminal.

3. Both are behavioral and variable heavy programs that can implement methods to perform actions for example math.

Differences

1. Ruby will primarily be operated using the server side for programming.

2. Casing while using Ruby example naming conventions for variables will be primarily in snake_case while javascript will primarily be camel.

3. Unlike Javascripts variable naming structure, with Ruby we don't have to use const, var, let etc.

Researched answer(s):
1. Both languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled,    allowing for quick interations and easy debugging during development.

2. Both Ruby and Javascript are dynamically typed languages meaning variable types are determined at runtime rather than being explicitly declared. 

3. Both languages hava a rich array of third-party libraries available for download. 

1. Javascript may be used as a front or back end language but ruby is reserved for back end development.

2. Ruby can track how much memory is being used, but javascript does not.

3. The syntax of Ruby is far more straightforward than Javascripts. Javascript requires proper location of curly braces and other punctuation marks.

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: To create a test watch it fail then create the code that makes the test pass.

Researched answer: It emphasizes the importance of writing tests early in the development process, maintaining a comprehensive suite of the tests, and using test as a tool for driving the design and evolution of code.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A function using do and end syntax to pass solutions.

Researched answer: In Ruby a block is a chunk of code enclosed within either curly braces or do end and can be passed to methods as an argument and executed within the context of the methods's implementation. 

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Answer: It's a tool used to manage multiple versions of programming language runtimes.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms.

1. Database migrations: A file that is generated through a Rails terminal command that allows us to make changes to the database schema.

2. Model validations: A tool used to ensure that only clean and valid data gets saved into the database.

3. Params: Allows you to choose which attributes should be permitted for mass updating and thus prevent accidentally exposing that which should not be exposed.
